Deployment of the applications (rest.war and app.war) must be done on Payara as it uses EL expressions in @DataSourceDefinition what is Payara specific.

Also, MySQL needs to be available, using the following docker command for example

docker run --name mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -e MYSQL_USER=rubus -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=rubus -e MYSQL_DATABASE=rubus -d -p 33060:33060 -p 3306:3306  mysql:5.7.33


./asadmin deploy <path-to>/app.war


./asadmin deploy <path-to>/rest.war

curl localhost:8080/rest/data/todo

http://localhost:8080/app/index.xhtml

curl -v --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"title":"xyz","description":"the long description for TODO"}' \
